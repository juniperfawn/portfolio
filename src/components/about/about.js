          My name is Cera Kocher. I am a Swiss American Creative Developer who
          originally grew up in Colorado, USA but now currently is based out of
          the Netherlands. I completed my University degrees in Media Production
          and Media Design with a minor in Engineering of Technology Arts &
          Media.{" "}

          My interests span a wide spectrum of endeavors, ranging from digital
          design and web development to the exhilarating realm of experiences
          that fuel my creativity and zest for life.{" "}

          For instance, I acquired my motorcycle license and promptly adorned my
          bike with a personalized paint job. At 19 I delved into the world of
          Muay Thai, reaching a level where I could participate in amateur
          competitions. A certified White Water Raft Guide, a seasoned barista
          of nearly a decade, and a solo sojourn to the Arctic Circle to master
          the art of mushing sled dogs are just a few chapters of my adventurous
          journey.{" "}

          Venturing into Indie Game Development, evolving from a photography
          hobbyist to a professional photographer, and sustaining a lifelong
          commitment to global exploration are among my ongoing pursuits. Life,
          for me, is a tapestry of experiences and connections. Fueled by an
          insatiable curiosity about the workings of the world, I find joy in
          being an active participant. This philosophy has guided me across the
          globe, forming deeply rewarding connections and experiences. At my
          core, I am someone enchanted by the magic of personal growth and
          relentless pursuit-a firm believer that lifeâ€™s richness lies in the
          experiences it offers.{" "}
